# Saikai - Manage your way to work 💯

The user who sends a lot of resumes can easily get lost and not remember which company the resume was sent to and which company has not yet been sent. That is why the app - **_Saikai_** - (Resume in Japanese) was established.

_Saikai_ is designed to create order and organization, along with determining the status and documentation of sending a resume while looking for a job.

_Saikai_ helps us to track the sending of resumes to the various companies, update as soon as the resume is received by a particular company and update relevant status when receiving an answer (positive / negative / homework, etc.).
